## About Patlabor API

This project aims to provide information and images of the anime Mobile Police Patlabor.

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract that allow developers to interact with an application through a set of interfaces. In this case, the application is a database with patlabor-anime information, and the interfaces are URL links. A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose conventions based on HTTP verbs, errors, and hyperlinks.
